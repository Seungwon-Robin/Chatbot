🎵 Music Recommendation Chatbot Development Result Report1. Service Planning Overview and BackgroundEvery morning, the moment I wake up and get ready for school, my mood is different. The Music Recommendation Chatbot was conceived with the goal of accurately identifying the subtle emotions a user expresses through natural language and recommending the optimal music for that mood.I realized that by eliminating the cumbersome process of searching for good music during each person's unique morning routine, users could simply tell the chatbot their mood and instantly receive high-quality music recommendations. This, I believe, could make the user's day happier and more efficient.This service is designed to be highly personalized and is expected to become an excellent tool for maximizing the User Experience (UX).2. System ArchitectureThe chatbot utilizes a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture to combine the power of a Large Language Model (LLM) with external, up-to-date data.Getty Images Explore StageDescriptionKey ComponentsUser InputThe user inputs a query to the chatbot using natural language.User QuestionRetrievalSearches the local database (DB) for music data highly relevant to the keywords in the user's query.JSON Dataset (Local DB)AugmentationThe retrieved data snippets are used to construct a context-rich prompt for the LLM.Prompt CompositionGenerationThe LLM generates the final recommendation based on the provided context.LLM (Gemini Agent)3. Implementation DetailsCore TechnologyThe system is built upon the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model, which effectively combines the generative capabilities of the LLM with the accuracy of external data. This hybrid approach mitigates issues like LLM "hallucination" and ensures recommendations are grounded in a verified music dataset.Data Source ManagementData Structure: Music information is stored locally in a CSV file (music_db.csv), functioning as the system's music knowledge base.Data Content: This dataset includes essential metadata such as genre, artist, song title, and potentially mood tags or BPM (Beats Per Minute), allowing for sophisticated retrieval.Generation Prompt & LLM UtilizationContext Formulation: The music information (genre, artist, title, etc.) retrieved from the local DB is dynamically composed and presented to the LLM as the prompt context.LLM Role: The Gemini Agent is instructed to take on the persona of a "Professional Music Curator". With the provided context, the Agent not only lists the recommended songs but also generates an expert-level explanation (e.g., "The soft, lo-fi beats of this track are perfect for calming pre-school jitters") for the recommendation, significantly enriching the final user answer and enhancing engagement.
